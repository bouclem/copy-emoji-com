# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a web application that allows users to easily browse, search, and copy emojis to their clipboard. The website will organize emojis into categories and maintain a history of recently used emojis for quick access. The primary goal is to provide a simple, efficient way for users to find and copy emojis for use in other applications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to browse emojis organized by categories, so that I can easily find the type of emoji I'm looking for.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user visits the website THEN the system SHALL display emoji categories (e.g., smileys, animals, food, activities, travel, objects, symbols, flags)
2. WHEN the user clicks on a category THEN the system SHALL display all emojis within that category
3. WHEN emojis are displayed THEN the system SHALL show each emoji with its Unicode character and name

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to copy an emoji to my clipboard by clicking on it, so that I can paste it into other applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks on an emoji THEN the system SHALL copy the emoji to the clipboard
2. WHEN an emoji is copied THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback (e.g., brief highlight or notification)
3. WHEN an emoji is copied THEN the system SHALL add it to the recently used emojis list

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my most recently used emojis in a dedicated section, so that I can quickly access emojis I use frequently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user visits the website THEN the system SHALL display a "Recently Used" section at the top of the page
2. WHEN the user copies an emoji THEN the system SHALL add it to the recently used list
3. WHEN the recently used list exceeds 20 emojis THEN the system SHALL remove the oldest emoji
4. WHEN the user clicks on a recently used emoji THEN the system SHALL copy it to the clipboard

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search for emojis by name or keyword, so that I can quickly find specific emojis without browsing categories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user types in the search box THEN the system SHALL filter emojis based on name or keywords
2. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL highlight matching text in emoji names
3. WHEN the search box is empty THEN the system SHALL display all categories and recently used emojis

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the website to be responsive and work well on mobile devices, so that I can use it on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the website on a mobile device THEN the system SHALL display a mobile-optimized layout
2. WHEN the user accesses the website on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL adjust the emoji grid layout accordingly
3. WHEN the user taps an emoji on mobile THEN the system SHALL copy it to the clipboard and provide haptic feedback if available

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want my recently used emojis to persist between sessions, so that I don't lose my frequently used emojis when I close the browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user closes and reopens the browser THEN the system SHALL restore the previously used emojis list
2. WHEN the user clears browser data THEN the system SHALL reset the recently used emojis list
3. WHEN the user uses the website on different devices THEN the system SHALL maintain separate recently used lists per device
